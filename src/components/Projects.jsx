        I briefly worked on a rewards app for small local businesses as a jr
        developer. We helped work on a website using react, which was meant to
        help small businesses save money.

        I have been developing a horror themed clicker game over the last 6
        months. It is a personal project of mine, is being developed in Game
        Maker Studio 2, and is my first ever game.
